    "question": "What is the historical maximum average temperature in summer?",
    "answer": "The historical maximum average temperature in spring at {location} is {tempmax_seas_hist_summer}°C. This represents the observed baseline climate conditions, typically using a 1980–2010 reference period for that season."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the historical minimum average temperature in summer?",
    "answer": "The historical minimum average temperature in spring at {location} is {tempmin_seas_hist_summer}°C. This represents the observed baseline climate conditions, typically using a 1980–2010 reference period for that season."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the projected maximum average temperature in summer under RCP 8.5 by mid century?",
    "answer": "The projected maximum average temperature at {location} in summer under RCP 8.5 by mid century is {tempmax_seas_rcp85_mid_summer}°C. This reflects anticipated warming trends due to climate change."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the projected minimum average temperature in summer under RCP 8.5 by mid century?",
    "answer": "The projected minimum average temperature in summer under RCP 8.5 by mid century is {tempmin_seas_rcp85_mid_summer}°C. This reflects anticipated warming trends due to climate change."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the historical maximum average temperature in summer compared to {compared_location}?",
    "answer": "The historical maximum average temperature in summer at {location} is {tempmax_seas_hist_summer}°C, which is {'higher' if tempmax_seas_hist_summer > tempmax_seas_hist_summer_loc2 else 'lower'} compared to {compared_location}'s {tempmax_seas_hist_summer_loc2}°C."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the projected annual precipitation under RCP 8.5 by mid century?",
    "answer": "The projected annual precipitation at {location} under RCP 8.5 by mid century is {precipann_rcp85_midc} mm, which may increase or decrease depending on regional climate dynamics."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the historical annual total of cooling degree days?",
    "answer": "The historical annual total of cooling degree days at {location} is {cdd_hist}, representing the energy demand for cooling based on past climate."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the projected annual total of cooling degree days under RCP 8.5 by mid century?",
    "answer": "The projected annual total of cooling degree days at {location} under RCP 8.5 by mid century is {cdd_rcp85_midc}, indicating higher energy demand for cooling due to future warming."
